Simpleton (From Sponge Bob SquarePants: Simple-Ton, 
A ton of simple things to do.) is a POC project which 
is not intended for production or scaleup and is 
neither efficient nor eloquent.

It is an exploration to start an AI model small with
very little data (currently less than 50 words in the 
lexicon), and with minimal, but expandable KB's. Also, 
along the way, to develop learning algorithms that 
are not based on using predictive techniques which 
use large corpora.

The idea is from the understanding that a child does 
not read million-word corpora to understand 
“See Dick run with the ball”.
